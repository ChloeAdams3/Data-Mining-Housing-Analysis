# Project Title 
Data Mining Housing Analysis

# Description 
Utilized Orange to gain experience in solving a data mining problem collaboratively through the CRISP-DM. Our goal was to predict Des Moines housing prices using housing characteristics making this a regression data mining problem. In predicting the prices, we wanted to use the least number of features without compromising model accuracy. To acheive this goal, we built models using Linear Regression, Random Forests, and Boosting to see which models were the most accurate and effective on the validation set. 

# Steps
1. Selected Des Moines Housing Data for project
2. Cleaned the data utilizing R programming language
3. Performed Exploratory Analysis to find interesting insights
4. Built initial models utilizing different model types
5. Tuned hyperparameters of the models to minimize error and prevent overfiitng and underfitting
6. Selected model with the least error that best fit the business problem
7. Presented findings through a presentation and report
